# Refactor-this
The attached project is a poorly written products API in C#.

Please evaluate and refactor areas where you think can be improved.

Consider all aspects of good software engineering and show us how you'll make it #beautiful and make it a production ready code.

# Getting started for applicants
## Introduction
This is a web api application built with .net 5.
> Theoretically speaking it should also backward support to run on asp.net core 3.1. 
> Please refer to [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dotnet-five)

### Design
Product is the core entity. 
```json
{
  // ID is uuid, PK of the entity
  "Id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  // Name and Description for now there's no constraint, could be empty.
  "Name": "Product name",
  "Description": "Product description",
  // Price and Delivery Price is stored in decimal. no limitation
  "Price": 123.45,
  "DeliveryPrice": 12.34,
  // Status is flag for indicating whether the product is active/inactive. 
  // When deleve, it only set the status to inactive for future re-use.
  "Status": 0
}
```

ProductOption is the option of each product
```json
{
  // Id should be uuid and is the PK
  "Id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  // Product Id can not be null. Product to Option is 1-to-N relationship.
  // Product could be no option attaches but one option must link to a product.
  "ProductId": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  // Name and Description for now there's no constraint, could be empty.
  "Name": "Product name",
  "Description": "Product description"
}
```

API document please refer to below section or swagger document.

## How to build
1. restore packages:
```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
```
2. data migration and seeding
```bash
    dotnet ef database update
```
> please install relevant ef core tools and package

expect to see bash like below:
```console
➜  ProductApi git:(master) ✗ dotnet ef database update
Build started...
Build succeeded.

Done.
```

3. run
```bash
    # option 1: CLI
    dotnet run
    
    # option 2: IDEs
    run debug/run mode.
```

4. play with

default browser should open [https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html](https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html) automatically. 

5. deploy

Docker file has supplied. please modify relevant setup to fit in your container and pipeline.

```
# Docker cmd
# Please make sure you are in the solution folder, not in project folder.
docker build -t product-api .
docker run -it --rm -p 2333:80 --name product_api product-api
```



## Endpoint instruction

There should be these endpoints:

> Same swagger document should also be seen after start the project at `https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html`.

1. `GET /products` - gets all products.
2. `GET /products?name={name}` - finds all products matching the specified name.
3. `GET /products/{id}` - gets the project that matches the specified ID - ID is a GUID.
4. `POST /products` - creates a new product.
5. `PUT /products/{id}` - updates a product.
6. `DELETE /products/{id}` - deletes a product and its options.
7. `GET /products/{id}/options` - finds all options for a specified product.
8. `GET /products/{id}/options/{optionId}` - finds the specified product option for the specified product.
9. `POST /products/{id}/options` - adds a new product option to the specified product.
10. `PUT /products/{id}/options/{optionId}` - updates the specified product option.
11. `DELETE /products/{id}/options/{optionId}` - deletes the specified product option.

All models are specified in the `/Models` folder, but should conform to:

}
```

**Product Option:**
```json
{
  "Id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
